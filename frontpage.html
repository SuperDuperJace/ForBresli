        <h1>Things I've Learned About Love From Bresli Nareisa Silva Godinez</h1>
        <p>
Make everyday feel like the first, make every kiss feel like the last, <br>
Never bad mouth her friends, <br>
If she bad mouths her friends, take her side. <br>
If she bad mouths your friends, she’s probably right. <br>
Never keep her up past one if she has work or class early in the morning, <br>
And in the morning, when her hair is more tangled than the Chicago Bears offense <br>
and her breath smells as deadly as the kitchen when your mom is making salsa, <br>
Understand she won’t always look pretty, <br>
But thank god she will always be beautiful. <br>
Be genuine. <br>
Be truthful. <br>
You cannot be honest with her until you first become honest with yourself <br>
Be respectful to her parents. <br>
Love her family as your own <br>
Learn that love is not a straight line from you to her, <br>
But rather a circle that encompasses her and everyone she holds close to her heart. <br>
Compliment her always. <br>
Expensive gifts are never as valuable as the amount of attention you give <br>
Embrace her always <br>
Let your arms be the cradle her that catch her when she falls <br>
Let your shoulders be the blanket that catches her tears, <br>
Learn which battles are worth fighting, and which ones you just have to let slide <br>
Put your own stubbornness aside <br>
Hurtful words never solve an argument <br>
Kind words heal all wounds <br>
No matter the argument, <br>
She always wins. <br>
Her emotions will always supersede her need to make sense <br>
Accept the fact that more often than not she will fall asleep during any move that you pick <br>
Accept the fact that more often than not she will make you watch the movies she likes, <br>
And you must find it within yourself to try to stay awake <br>
I can say with great confidence, Tangled was not that bad… <br>
Accept that you will always have your differences <br>
Differences in opinion, <br>
Differences in point of view, <br>
Differences in the way you each handle situations <br>
Differences are what make us unique <br>
Men are from mars, women are aliens <br>
Learn to listen <br>
Most times she is not looking for advice, <br>
Most times she just wants to vent, <br>
Give advice only when she asks or when she is lost <br>
And when you give it, <br>
Don’t be preachy or patronizing, <br>
You are not her father, <br>
You are not her priest, <br>
Have faith, <br>
Nothing will bring you closer than faith, <br>
Not having faith at the center of your lives is like having a see-saw without a rock in the middle <br>
And like a see-saw let faith take you through your ups and your downs <br>
As long as you stay on board it will be a more interesting ride. <br>
Eat everything she cooks, <br>
She is not a michelin chef, <br>
Be grateful for the sandwiches she makes, and apples she doesn't share <br>
Be careful of being too critical <br>
Be careful of comparing her dish to how your mother use to make it <br>
Look past her faults <br>
No one is perfect, not even yourself <br>
Ask permission before spending money, <br>
Ask permission before going out, <br>
Ask permission before <br>
Asking permission is not a sign of weakness, <br>
It is a sign of respect <br>
Respect is fragile <br>
So is trust <br>
Be careful of breaking either one, <br>
Do all you can to keep them in tact <br>
Don’t make promises you don’t intend to keep <br>
But if you feel you’ve dug a whole that’s a bit to deep, <br>
Tell her quickly, <br>
and humbly ask for forgiveness, <br>
Let go of past mistakes, <br>
Let go of past heartaches, <br>
Let go of past arguments <br>
The past is something you should both learn from, <br>
It is not something that should be brought up to prove a point, <br>
Love her, <br>
With every breath, <br>
Inhale her presence into your lungs, <br>
Exhale your gratitude in the form of love poems that roll off your tongue <br>
Let it shout from your throat, <br>
Pronounce her significance in your life to those who have lost all hope, <br>
Be the example, <br>
Be the pillar, <br>
Standing tall in a broken world of promiscuity and unpaid bills, <br>
In a broken world of divorce papers and child custody, <br>
In a broken world that has become oblivious to the one simple rule, <br>
Love her, <br>
With every heartbeat, <br>
Let your veins pump life into every inch of your soul, <br>
That you may love her with nothing less than everything, <br>
That your veins pump until she hears the beat of your music, <br>
Let the choir sing your song <br>
Let the angels play your harp <br>
Let your love be the light that takes you through the dark, <br>
and when all else fails <br> 
love her deeper, <br>
And always, <br>
pretend like you didn't know she just farted <br>
