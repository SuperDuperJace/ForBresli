        <p>
            It all started on December 10th. <br>
            I had just gotten off my shift late at night, and I drove 2 hours to you for the first time. It was the first time we met, and I think it was the first time I ever drove for that long. I remember I ran up to Walgreens to get flowers, and the line was so long I didn't get to eat on my break. I don't think I ate much that day because my stomach was full of butterflies. I was nervous because I knew  I was going to meet you. And what if we didn't hit it off right, or what if you didn't come out from your dorm room because it was so late. What if you just thought I was uglier in person and you didn't want to come out. <br>
            Still. I drove to you. <br>
            I took a shot to calm down the nerves and I said bye to my friends, not knowing what time I would return from seeing you. We had the night of our lives. I don't go on many dates, but from the few that I've been on, nothing could have ever surpassed ours. I remember that entire weekend it felt like I hadn't slept, maybe it's because I didn't. But I wanted to cherish every second I had with you. That next night at Mary Annes, I knew what I wanted. It was you. You and me bonded together for years to come. You made me smile and laugh like I hadn't smiled and laughed in a long time. We started our relationship that night. And it has been the most beautiful thing I could have imagined. Hell, I don't even think I could have imagined it if I tried. <br>
            Fast forward 7 months and some weeks later. We don't talk and that's my fault. I've been going through some things. And I'm not trying to tell you that I'm better now, if anything I've gotten worse. And since we've broken up there hasnt been a single day that I don't think about you and there isn't a single day that I don't worry about you. Worry that someone has taken you out and they're going to fast on the curves on the highway. Worry that you had a bad day at work and you don't have someone to tell and talk about your weird customers about. Worry that you've had a bad day in general and you're going to sleep sad. I worry about you all the time and I just want you to know that I love you. I miss you. <br>
            I haven't been able to bring myself to throw anything of yours out or delete anything between us. I'm glad I haven't. <br>
            As the days have gone by I remember the times we had together and how even in the end of it all, through all the fighting and screaming and crying, I would do it all over again. I would drive another two hours to you for the first time. I would wait at union station on cold nights and sit in the car for hours talking to you and forgetting there's a whole world out there. I would drive through another blizzard just to end up seeing you. And I would go ice skating with you just to see you fall all over again. I would go to my first baile and my next baile with you all over again and again and again. You made my life better. You made me better. And I'm not okay right now but that doesn't matter because I'm not okay with or without you, I'd rather it be beside you because our story is more than perfect. I want you back. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes. You change my life for the better and there's no denying it. I just hope I have made your life just as good as you made mine. <br><br>
            You've taught me so much Bresli, and this poem is just some of the things I've learned about love from you. And I know you wanted something but this is from the heart, all of this.
